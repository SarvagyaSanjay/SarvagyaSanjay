# 💫 About Me:
Final year student from the dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering, PES University, Bangalore. I have a keen interest in embedded systems and firmware development, with hands-on experience working on ESP32-S3–based platforms. I have designed and implemented a secure Over-The-Air (OTA) firmware update system supporting both Wi-Fi and GSM connectivity.
<!---
- 🧠 Focused on:
  - Reliability and fail-safe update mechanisms
  - Flash partition planning
  - Firmware integrity validation--->
- 🛠️ working with:
  - LittleFS
  - OTA update
  - MD5 checksum verification
  - Fault detection and handling
- 🧪 Solved challenges such as:
  - Incomplete or interrupted firmware downloads
  - Boot-loop prevention due to invalid firmware

In addition to embedded systems, I also hold a keen interest in data analytics and business intelligence, I have hands-on experience in SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel, where I have worked on academic projects and personal initiatives to analyze datasets, create visual dashboards, and draw actionable insights. My background in engineering has strengthened my problem-solving, logical thinking, and attention to detail. I am eager to apply my skills in real-world scenarios, learn from industry professionals, and contribute to data-driven decision-making in a professional environment.
